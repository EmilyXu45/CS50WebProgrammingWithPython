        The style red is repeated, when it needs to be changed (for example to a different color), it will have to be changed in multiple places.
        Sass is not able to be understood by web browsers. So Sass files needs to be compiled first, this means we will have to use: sass variables.scss: variables.css in the terminal
        Sass is an extension to css. All things done by sass can be done using css, however sass makes it easier and avoids repetition. To let sass compile automatically, we can use sass --watch 
        What this does is that it monitors your source files for changes and recompile the file automatically the next time it is saved.
